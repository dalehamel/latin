Eō irregularities: the normal stem vowel, {{c1::ī}}-, seen in the present infinitive, becomes {{c1::e}}- before {{c1::a, o, and u::letter(s)}} in the {{c1::1a) present indicative and 1b) present subjunctive, 2) non-nominative-sg forms of the present participle, 3a) gerund and 3b) gerundive (rare)::verbal form categor(y/ies)}}.
