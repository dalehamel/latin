Typical examples of main clauses introducing relative clauses of characteristic are "{{c2::sunt quī}}," meaning, "{{c1::there are people who}}," "{{c2::quis est quī}}," meaning, "{{c1::who is there who}}," and, "{{c2::nēmō est quī}}," meaning, "{{c1::there is no one who}}."	Wheelock	38	
Some relative-pronoun clauses are not of characteristic, but have the force of {{c1::result, purpose, causal, or adversative clauses}} where the relative pronoun {{c1::stands in for ut, nē, or cum}}, and so also, like relative clauses of characteristic, {{c1::have a subordinate verb in the subjunctive mood}}.	Wheelock	38	
The supine is a/an {{c1::fourth}} declension verbal noun based on the same stem as the {{c1::perfect passive participle AKA fourth principal part}}; only two forms were in common use: {{c1::the accusative and ablative singular}}.	Wheelock	38	
Not only is "arbor, arboris" {{c1::feminine::gender}}, but so regularly are {{c1::the names of individual trees, regardless of declension}}.	Wheelock	38
