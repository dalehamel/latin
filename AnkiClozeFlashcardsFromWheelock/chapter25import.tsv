The supine in -um is identical to {{c1::the neuter nominative singular of the perfect passive participle}}, also known as {{c1::the fourth principal part}}.	Wheelock	25	
When a participle is employed as a component of an infinitive, {{c1::they are essentially predicate adjectives and agree in usage with the subject of esse}}.	Wheelock	25	
Although literal tranlations using the English preposition "to" exist, in actual use the {{c1::perfect and particularly the future}} infinitives are rarely translated literally; only {{c1::present}} infinitives are.	Wheelock	25	
An infinitive can function as a {{c1::subject}}, {{c1::objective complement, as with possum and dēbeō}}, {{c1::direct object, with its own accusative subject}}, or {{c1::as an indirect statement}}.	Wheelock	25	
In English we regularly put indirect statements into {{c1::a subordinate clause introduced by "that"}}.	Wheelock	25	
The indirect statement is regularly employed in Latin after verbs of {{c1::speech, mental activity, or sense perception}}, sometimes called {{c1::"head verbs"}}.	Wheelock	25	
In classical Latin, the accusative subject of an indirect statement is {{c1::always expressed}}, even when {{c1::the subject of the sentence is also the object}}, thus (usually) necessitating {{c1::a reflexive pronoun}}.	Wheelock	25	
As with participles, the tenses of the infinitive are {{c1::relative to the tense of the main verb}}, not {{c1::absolute}}.	Wheelock	25
