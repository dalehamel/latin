# Latin

Study materials for the Latin language, mainly from the text
_Wheelock's Latin_ and in a format for import to the best-in-class
spaced repetition flashcard software, Anki.

I'll continue to add my initial imports. Maybe someday I'll publish
the deck through AnkiWeb, and this will become the readme for the deck.

### Features

* All conjugations (1,2,3,3io,4) inverted from Wheelock presentation
  for focus on reading comprehension rather than writing/speaking
  skills.  The template is, front: [conj., prin. part, Latin verb
  ending without macrons], back: [ending with macrons, person, number,
  tense, mood, voice], including distinguishment in p/n/t/m/v
  depending on macron

* All declensions (1,2,3,3istem,4,5) noun forms inverted from Wheelock
  presentation also for focus on reading comprehension. front: [decl.,
  gender, Latin noun ending without macrons], back: [ending with
  macrons, case, number], including distinguishment in c/n depending
  on macron

* Adjectives categorized (1/2, 3, 3presActPart, 3comparative) also
  inverted.  front: [decl., Latin adj or presActPart ending] back:
  [gender, case, number, (degree)], including distinguishment of
  g/c/n/(d) depending on macron

* Relatives, interrogatives, pronouns, etc., all with front: as the
  Latin word, stem, base, or ending.

* Care taken with POS collision on word forms, e.g. vÄ«s or relative
  and interrogative, to keep the focus on reading comprehension.

* Intensive coverage of explanatory text, including case uses for
  difficult words (subjunctive case uses, including ut and cum,
  genitive use cases). Keep the "bury" function in Anki in mind with
  these; they are generated as three separate cards, each one mapping
  one of [caseUseName, recognition, comprehension] to the other two.
  They ought to be linked as different clozes in a single note are,
  and thus buried automatically when one of the other two in the
  triplet are studied.  I may misunderstand cloze deletions but can't
  get this three-way mapping done, so simply manually bury cards when
  I've already seen this front on another of the triplet's back's.

* all chapter vocabulary (glosses excluded), including macrons and
  accents, exactly as presented in Wheelock version 7, though typos
  are mine, in both reading- and writing- focused clozes.
  
### Usage

First, install the free desktop application from http://ankisrs.net.
Then, import some of these tsvs as cloze import.  These TSV
representations have my human data-entry errors, because Anki has
extensive editing, addon and import/export support, so I clean it up
in there.  Sorry!  If/when I publish on ankiweb, they'll all be
cleaned up, along with additional cards I added directly.

In particular, be careful either to leave the HTML import box
unchecked or else ensure everything is HTML compliant (which is to
make sure no &, <, nor > are in the files, unless as intended for
HTML) before import.

The browser allows you to view cards with an extensive search
language.  Furthermore, the same search language allows you to create
filtered decks, which is how this deck was prepared to be used, in
accordance with the design of the Anki software package itself, which
doesn't handle large numbers of decks, as with one deck per chapter.
By studying the cards in this deck from filtered decks instead of from
the main deck created upon import of the tsv files, everything here
can be imported once (as best you can) and then adjusted regardless
of import order to focus on the parts of this whale to digest.

For example, try some of the following progressive chapter filter
searches.  Note also that, per the Anki manual, "You can hold down
Ctrl (command on a Mac) and click in order to append the clicked
[sidebar] item to the current search with an AND condition, instead of
starting a new search."  Thus however far you are along in Wheelock's
Latin, you can start with one of the searches below and append any
tags from the sidebar with ctrl or command click, or your own search
terms from among what you've already studied.
