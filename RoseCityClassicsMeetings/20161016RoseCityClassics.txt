Hans Fredrich Mueller -- Latin instructor Great Courses
Passive and Subjunctive / Indirect statements
-- topics that aren't generally covered early, but can be, by Mueller, and by Ben's initial class
Mark Miner has done recordings not only of meter but also
800-600 BC Homeric, Attic, Koine, Doric, Ionian all dialects of ancient Greek
Ben recommends Ovid prior to Horace
Caesar is a common author for easier-to-read Roman texts
Eutropeus is another for simple, straightforward Latin relative to Livy

Tacitus per Ben is best for reading (though very difficult reading),
because he puts a lot of personality into it and isn't necessarily a
fan of the Romans; very quick to call them on their bullshit

Tacitus died under Trajan; the second of the five good emperors

Domitian (last of Flavian dynasty) had gotten a bad rap for
terrorizing the senate, but they were terrorizing the public.  When he
dies, elect Nerva who adopts Trajan.  There is extant correpsondence
with Pliny.  Then Hadrian, Antonius Pius, then Marcus Aurelius.
